Natural Language Processing (NLP) Projects

This repository showcases multiple Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects that cover both supervised and unsupervised techniques for text classification and conversational AI. Each project demonstrates the complete NLP pipeline, from text preprocessing to feature extraction and model evaluation.

üìÇ Projects Included

1. Sentiment Analysis
	‚Ä¢	Predicts whether text expresses positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.
	‚Ä¢	Includes preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization).
	‚Ä¢	Uses feature extraction techniques like TF-IDF and classification models.

2. Chatbot
	‚Ä¢	A simple conversational agent capable of handling basic user queries.
	‚Ä¢	Demonstrates intent classification and rule/ML-based responses.
	‚Ä¢	Can be extended with deep learning models for more natural conversations.

3. Spam Detection
	‚Ä¢	Classifies messages as Spam or Ham (Not Spam).
	‚Ä¢	Useful in email/SMS filtering applications.
	‚Ä¢	Evaluated with metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.

4. True vs Fake News Detection
	‚Ä¢	Detects whether a news article is real or fake.
	‚Ä¢	Applies NLP techniques to process and vectorize large text datasets.
	‚Ä¢	Helps in addressing misinformation and fake news problems.
